"""
This module contains the base class for a player in a chess game.

The player is responsible for picking a move given a board.
The player can also simulate a self-play game (rollout) from the current position.

This module also defines some simple players:
- Player: returns the first legal move.
- RandomPlayer: returns a random legal move.
- GreedyPlayer: returns a move that directly wins, or a move that does not directly lose.
